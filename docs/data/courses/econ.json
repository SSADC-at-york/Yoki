Also, the course examines in detail the various aspects of the insurance mechanism as a route to manage some of the aforementioned risks.

For each idea/topic/problem relevant mathematical ideas and techniques are recalled and/or derived so as to provide a deeper understanding of the Economic issue and how it can be resolved, if necessary. The notion of Quantity Demanded is first addressed by expressing quantity demanded as a linear function of price where both the slope and intercept embed important Economics ideas. This sequence leads naturally to the notion of Revenue (the product of quantity demanded and price) where nonlinear functions are analyzed using mathematical techniques that include derivatives. This sequence culminates with notions of prices that maximize revenue subject to a given demand function.

The issues and problems covered require functions of more than one variable for their resolution. The notion of Quantity Supplied is combined with the notion of Quantity Demanded and notions of Market Equilibrium are introduced and discussed. Equilibria are evaluated through the introduction of mathematical notions and properties of systems of equations, eventually in matrix form. A deeper understanding of theories of demand (supply) and the foundations of demand (supply) functions is developed through the introduction of mathematical notions of unconstrained and constrained optimization and linear and nonlinear programming. As in AP/ECON 1530 3.00, many topics and issues are addressed and problem framing and problem solving abilities are enhanced.\nPrerequisite: AP/ECON 1530 3.00 or equivalent.\n Prerequisites or corequisites: AP/ECON 1000 3.00 or AP/ECON 1010 3.00, or equivalent. \nNo Credit Retained (NCR) Note: Students who have successfully completed or who are currently enrolled in SC/MATH 1021 3.00, SC/MATH 1025 3.00, or SC/MATH 2221 3.00.
