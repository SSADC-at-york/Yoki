# Yorku REST api *for all things York Univesity*

### The problem ❓

I wanted a yorku API that I could use to automate tasks, navigate efficiently, find buildings, libraries cool hangout/study spots and so on.
#### And maybe create an app around it to help other students ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

---

### The solution 💡
Use Yorku official api, using endpoints they provide BUT THE ISSUE WAS  Yorku doesn't have an api, so I ended up creating my own.

### Who can use it? ✅
Everyone. We welcome new contributions to our community.

### Endpoints 💻
- Food Building database, including open - close time.
- More to come... like courses, their ratings?, study spots, and so on.
